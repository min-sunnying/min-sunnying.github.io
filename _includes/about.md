I am a researcher and designer specializing in AI-driven educational technologies. My work focuses on developing large language model (LLM) applications that foster personalized learning environments and reimagine the role of teachers in AI-enhanced classrooms. I combine a background in industrial design and electrical engineering with hands-on experience in user research, qualitative/quantitative analysis, and human-centered design.

I earned my M.S in [Industrial Design](https://id.kaist.ac.kr) from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), where I was member of [AI Experience Lab]() supervised by Professor [Tak Yeon Lee](https://takyeonlee.com). I also obtained my B.S in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/) with a Minor in Industrial Design from KAIST.

I have contributed to projects that integrate LLMs into English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, including designing learning analytics dashboards, evaluating student–AI interactions, and developing teacher-support tools. My research has been published at venues such as ACM Learning @ Scale, NeurIPS workshops, and LREC-COLING.

Beyond academia, I bring practical experience from industry—consulting on AI agent design, and governing Microsoft Power Platform at [KT Corp.](https://corp.kt.com/eng/). With a strong interest in human-centered and ethical evaluation of AI in education, I aim to bridge cutting-edge technology with meaningful impact in learning environments.
