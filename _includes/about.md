I am interested in designing large language model (LLM) applications for education, with the aim of creating personalized learning environments. My current research focuses on generating English course content using LLMs, informed by interaction data between ChatGPT and EFL students. I plan to expand my research to explore innovative teaching methods that redefine the role of teachers in AI-enhanced classrooms. My ultimate goal is to integrate diverse AI technologies to optimize educational environments for all stakeholders.

I earned my M.S in [Industrial Design](https://id.kaist.ac.kr) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) and  B.S in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/) with a Minor in Industrial Design from KAIST. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Research and Development Engineer at [Repla Inc.](http://repla.kr/?redirect=no), where I contributed to UX/UI design and developed control interfaces for automated plastic sorting machines.

I have co-authored multiple publications in reputable conferences and workshops, including NeurIPS, EMNLP, LREC, and ACM Learning @ Scale. My work often involves collaborative projects aimed at enhancing learning experiences through AI-driven tools.
