**Abstract:**
The integration of generative AI in the field of education is actively being explored. In particular, ChatGPT has garnered significant interest, offering an opportunity to examine its effectiveness in English as a foreign language (EFL) education. To address this need, we present a novel learning platform called RECIPE (Revising an Essay with ChatGPT on an Interactive Platform for EFL learners). Our platform features two types of prompts that facilitate conversations between ChatGPT and students: (1) a hidden prompt for ChatGPT to take an EFL teacher role and (2) an open prompt for students to initiate a dialogue with a self-written summary of what they have learned. We deployed this platform for 213 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in EFL writing courses and seven instructors. For this study, we collect students' interaction data from RECIPE, including students' perceptions and usage of the platform, and user scenarios are examined with the data. We also conduct a focus group interview with six students and an individual interview with one EFL instructor to explore design opportunities for leveraging generative AI models in the field of EFL education.
